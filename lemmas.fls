Variable l
Variable m
Variable n

Variable r
Variable s

Lemma
  Suppose
    ∃m m = l
    n = l ⇒ r = s
  Then
    r = s
  Proof
    m is contained in m = l
    m is undefined 
    m is free in m = l by FreeVariable
    n is omitted from m = l
  Therefore
    r = s by ExistentialElimination

Lemma
  Suppose
    n = l
  Then
    ∃m m = l
  Proof
    m is contained in m = l
    m is undefined 
    m is free in m = l by FreeVariable
    n is omitted from m = l
  Therefore
    ∃m m = l by ExistentialIntroduction

Lemma
  Suppose
    n = n
  Then
    ∀m m = m
  Proof
    n is contained in n = n
    n is undefined
    n is free in n = n by FreeVariable
    m is undefined 
    m is omitted from n = n
  Therefore
    ∀m m = m by UniversalIntroduction

Lemma
  Suppose
    ∀m m = m
  Then
    n = n
  Proof
    n is contained in n = n
    n is undefined
    n is free in n = n by FreeVariable
    m is undefined 
    m is omitted from n = n
  Therefore
    n = n by UniversalElimination
