Lemma
  Suppose
    [U] |- R :: S
  Then
    ∃[V] [V] |- R :: S
  Proof
    [V] is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in [V] |- R :: S by FreeMetavariable
  Therefore
    ∃[V] [V] |- R :: S by MetaExistentialIntroduction

Lemma
  Suppose
    ∃[V] [V] |- R :: S
    [[U] |- R :: S] ... r = s
  Then
    r = s
  Proof
    [V] is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in [V] |- R :: S by FreeMetavariable
  Therefore
    r = s by MetaExistentialElimination

Lemma
  Suppose
    m = m
  Then
    ∀n n = n
  Proof
    m is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in m = m by FreeVariable
  Therefore
    ∀n n = n by UniversalIntroduction

Lemma
  Suppose
    ∀n n = n
  Then
    m = m
  Proof
    m is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in m = m by FreeVariable
  Therefore
    m = m by UniversalElimination

Lemma
  Suppose
    m = l
  Then
    ∃n n = l
  Proof
    n is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in n = l by FreeVariable
  Therefore
    ∃n n = l by ExistentialIntroduction

Lemma
  Suppose
    ∃n n = l
    [m = l] ... r = s
  Then
    r = s
  Proof
    n is 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 in n = l by FreeVariable
  Therefore
    r = s by ExistentialElimination
